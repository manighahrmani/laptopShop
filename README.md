A simple GUI for a laptop shop written in Python and using Tkinter.

## Requirements
* Python 3.6 or higher ([download Python here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or use the one on [AppsAnywhere](https://appsanywhere.port.ac.uk))

## How to run
1. Get the code on your machines using one of the following methods:
    * Clone the repository if you have Git installed ([download Git here](https://git-scm.com/downloads) or use 'Git GUI' on [AppsAnywhere](https://appsanywhere.port.ac.uk))
    by running the following command in terminal/Powershell:

          git clone https://github.com/manighahrmani/laptopShop

    * Download the repository as a zip file and extract it.

2. Run the `frontend.py` file to launch the application. You can do this in two ways:
    * Open the folder that contains the code in your IDE (e.g. PyCharm, Visual Studio Code, etc.) and run the `frontend.py` file.  
    * Open the command line and navigate to the directory that contains the repository using the `cd` command. Then, run the following command:
  
          python3 frontend.py
